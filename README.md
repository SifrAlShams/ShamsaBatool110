# About Me
I started my journey with **Classic Machine Learning**, building simple projects and implementing **Classic ML Models**, **Reinforcement Learning Projects**. As I continued to explore, I jumped into the boom of **GenAI** with **NLP** the foundation of **Large Language Models**. Then I covered **Transformer Architecture** from theoratical perspective along with the **Mathematical Flavor** by taking courses like **Linear Algebra**, **Probability** and **Statistics**. And then finally I landed onto **Langchain v0** and build my first ever LLM based project, a **Customer Support Chatbot with MySQL Database Connection in Langchain v0**. As the Langchain grew, so did my learning and experience with LLMs. And today I work with all of the following stuff.
- **Agentic Development with Langgraph**
- **n8n Integrations with CRMs, Meta, etc.**
- **Make.com**
- **GHL Automations**
- **Synthflow Calling Agents**
- **Livekit and Vapi Calling Agents**
